                                        <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                                            <div class="half-width">
                                                <p>I'm from Mayesville, South Carolina and I'm open to the possibilities of relocating. My journey into tech started with a degree in business and over 10 years of customer service experience. Along my journey through life, I realized how much I wanted a change in my job and where my career was heading. 
                                                    I started to learn how to code and with that, awakened my passion for design. I was hooked and wanted to learn so much more through ux design, visual design, front-end development and more.</p>
                                            </div>
                                            <div class="half-width">
                                                <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work.
                                                    Now I've made a full switch to ui/ux designer with front-end development skills. I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
